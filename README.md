# javascript-types-to-quality 📦✨

A practice repository focused on mastering **JavaScript fundamentals** through clean, well‑named, and readable code. The collection explores primitives and references, arrays and objects, naming best practices, execution flow, and simple but illustrative algorithms.

## 🎯 What this project practices

* ✅ Proper function naming and intent clarity
* ✅ Working with arrays & nested structures
* ✅ Copy vs mutate (spread, loops)
* ✅ Conditional logic & iteration
* ✅ Algorithmic thinking on simple tasks
* ✅ Clean output & predictable return values

## 🧩 Implemented Functions & Mini‑Apps

### 1) `largestOfAll()` 🔍

Returns an array containing the **largest number** from each sub‑array inside a 2D array.

---

### 2) `frakenSplice()` ✂️⚙️

Replicates slice+splice behavior: inserts elements of one array into another at a given index **without mutating inputs**.

---

### 3) `findElement()` 🔎

Searches an array and returns the **first item that passes a truth test** (predicate function). Helpers include tests for even numbers, length checks, and more.

---

### 4) `pyramid()` 🏗️

Builds a pyramid of characters pointing **upward or downward** depending on a boolean. Demonstrates string repetition, alignment, spacing, and rendering shapes with text.

---

### 5) Gradebook App 🎓📊

A tiny grading system composed of:

* `getAverage()` — class average
* `getGrade()` — letter grade
* `hasPassingGrade()` — pass/fail state
* `studentMsg()` — final formatted message with judgment

---

## 🚀 Running the project

Clone & run with Node:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/karianjahi/javascript-types-to-quality.git
cd javascript-types-to-quality
node source.js
```

---

## 🧠 Lessons reinforced

* Write **descriptive names** — no guessing intent
* Prefer **pure functions** when possible
* Use **loops and branching with intent**
* Keep examples and logs readable
* Lean on **incremental composition**
